Support
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analog Devices will provide **limited** online support for anyone using
the reference design with Analog Devices components via the
:ez:`fpga` FPGA reference designs forum.

It should be noted, that the older the tools' versions and release
branches are, the lower the chances to receive support from ADI
engineers.
